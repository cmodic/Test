### Note: *This homework is to be done in pairs!*
### Due: Thursday, March 1 11:59:59 PM

###Description

In the rehaul of the calmail system UC Berkeley CIO Shel Waggener has hired you to write a calendar application for the campus to use! The calendar allows for multiple users to create as many private calendars as they'd like, each containing several events that you can invite other users to as well! Shel contracted out some of the frontend work to your very own GSI Caroline Modic and has provided you with the following description: 
  * The ability to signup / login / logout users
    + Users must have a unique username
    + Users must have a username and password
  * Each user can create and view multiple calendars
    + Within the scope of a single user, calendar names are unique
    + Calendars must have a name, and can optionally have a description
  * Calendar can holds multiple events
    + Events must have a name, start and end time
  * Events can have multiple users attending them
    + You can invite users to an event when you create it
    + Invites can optionally have a message attached (same for all invited users)
    + If accepted the invitee assigns the event to a calendar in their account
    + Invites can be rejected by an invitee
    + Users can not be sent a second invite if one is already pending
    + You can not invite yourself to an event
    + Only the event owner can send invites
  * Events and Calendars can be deleted
    + Calendars must contain 0 events to be deleted
    + When an event owner deletes an event it is deleted from everyone attending it, otherwise it is only deleted for the invitee. 
  * Events and Calendars can be edited
    + Only the event owner can edit the event
    + When editing an event you can change the calendar the event belongs to (for simplicity only the event owner can do this as well) 

You can see a working version of the application at http://bearplanner.heroku.com

###Tools
For this assignment you will be developing with postgres/sqlite and ruby on rails on a virtual machine. You must download virtualbox and the vm by following the instructions at : http://alpha.saasbook.info/bookware-vm-instructions . You will need to unzip the vm*.zip file. If you are using a Mac you may have trouble unzipping this with the built in archive utility, I suggest installing The Unarchiver to do the job: http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver . 

Note: DO NOT install the updates when you run the VM. 

To obtain the homework files, you can run 

    % git pull

In your `cs186/sp12` repository that you previously cloned for `hw1`. The app can be found under 'hw3/bearplanner'. 

#### Running the app locally

To run the app locally you can launch: 
  % rails server
Then browse to localhost:3000 in the VM's browser to see your app!
Note if you see an error first run:
  % bundle install
Then continue with launching the server. 

#### Running the app on Heroku

To submit the code you will need to launch a heroku application with your app, you may also do this to debug. You will need to go to http://heroku.com and signup with a new account then follow these steps:

  % heroku login

Enter your login info when prompted (that you used to sign up at heroku.com) and respond 'yes' when it asks to create a public key. 

  % git init
  % git add .
  % git commint -m "init"
  % heroku create --stack cedar
  % git push heroku master

After that your heroku site should be up and running! It will tell you the url you can go to, or you can use the following line to open up the site in the browser:
  % heroku open


##Part I: Schema Design

To begin, we will design the database schema for the app and create the appropriate Rails models. 

###ActiveRecord Intro: Migrations
	
Rails uses a library called ActiveRecord for database access.  In Rails, we create tables in our database using "migrations".  For our purposes, a migration is just a fancy "CREATE TABLE ..." statement in Ruby code.

See here for everything you ever wanted to know about migrations: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html.  I'll try to give a brief summary below:

To create a new "Model" (a Ruby object that encapsulates a database table), as well as the underlying database table, you would use these commands:

  % cd hw3/bearplanner/
  % rails generate model Something

This will create a bunch of stuff for your new model ("Something").  The important files for our purposes are:

  % ~/hw4/rubysketch/app/models/something.rb
  % ~/hw4/rubysketch/db/migrate/[some_unique_id]_create_somethings.rb

You would put the table columns (including columns for foreign keys) in the _create_somethings.rb file (see ~/hw4/rubysketch/db/migrate/.

As an example, we have given you a migration for the "User" model (users table).  When you ran the "rake db:migrate" command above, Rails created the corresponding "users" table in Postgres.  You can find the migration in:

  % ~/hw4/rubysketch/db/migrate/20100415141316_create_users.rb

This migration creates a table called "Users" with columns:
  * a string field called "name"
  * a string field called "password"
  * an implicit field called "id", which is a primary key (a unique integer representing each tuple)
  * "created_at" and "updated_at", two timestamps that are included because of the line: "t.timestamps"

You can enforce integrity constraints in the database itself by adding them to the migration or enforce them in the model (see: /app/models/Users.rb). In this example we do the latter. 

### ActiveRecord Intro: Relationships
  You can optionally specify any relationships with other models (i.e., using has_one, has_many, belongs_to, and has_and_belongs_to_many) in the app/models/[modelname].rb file.

  For the "User" model, the corresponding "~/hw4/rubysketch/models/user.rb" is quite boring, because there are no relationships to define (we've only given you one model!).

  It is not required to specify relationships -- you can successfully complete the assignment by not editing any files in the "models/" directory.  However, specifying relationships makes writing code to access your database a bit simpler, as we highlight in the example below:

#### Relationships Example

Assume that we've created another model called OtherThing, and we have the following column in our "~/hw4/rubysketch/db/migrate/[some_unique_id]_create_somethings.rb" migration:

  % t.integer :other_thing_id

We will highlight the value of specifying relationships by showing code with and without them:

With relationships:

Assume that you have the following in your app/models/something.rb file:

  % class Something < ActiveRecord::Base
    % has_one :other_thing
  % end

    Now, here's some code you might write:

    //intuitively, these statements together represent the query "SELECT O.name from other_things O, somethings S WHERE S.id = 2 AND O.id = S.other_thing_id;"
    thing = Something.find_by_id(2)
    name = thing.other_thing.name

    Without relationships:

    Here's the same code, but without relationships:

    thing = Something.find_by_id(2)
    name = OtherThing.find_by_id(thing.other_thing_id).name

    Notice how we had to explicitly refer to the column name "other_thing_id", and look up the corresponding OtherThing record using find_by_id.  Putting "has_one :other_thing" in your model automatically lets you say ".other_thing", instead of having to refer to the column name explicitly.

### Your Assignment
You will be using Rails "migrations" to create the database. You may create whatever tables/models you wish but you may not edit the users migrations. You can however edit the users model if you wish to add relationships (although you do not need to). In order to update the database with these migrations you must run 
  % rake db:migrate
Or if you are on heroku
  % heroku run rake db:migrate

You can look in the database locally to see if everything is correct by running
  % sqlite3 db/development.sqlite3


##Part II: Backend Server Code

###Intro
Since you created your own models you will need to plug them  into our views through the controller methods. If you find yourself wishing you added another column to a database in step 1 you can do so easily check out the following link for details: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html#creating-a-standalone-migration. We have implemented login() signup() and logout() for you in /hw3/bearplanner/app/controller/bear_planner_controller.rb. You must implement the rest!

#### Important Notes:
  * If a user is logged in session[:uid] will contain their user id, otherwise it will be null.
  * All other input will be given to you in the "params" hash. 
  * You will give output by assigning it to the @VARIABLE variables we instruct you to. 
  * The views really on these variables having SPECIFIC names so please make sure you are accurate. 
  * Check out the before_filter lines at the top of the application "login_required" is definited for you in application_controller.rb, but you will need to implement the others. 
  * When the user has the option to submit a form, request.post? will return true if the user has submitted the form and false otherwise (see login() and signup()). 

#### show_calendars
  * Purpose: To show a list of calendars for a user. 
  * Input: None
  * Output: 
    *An array of hashes names "@calendarArray" each hash has the following fields:
      * 'id' - A identifier of the calendar
      * 'name' - A string with the name of the calendar
      * 'description' - A string with the description of the calendar

#### show_calendar
  * Purpose: To show all the events/information of a specific calendar.

      * 'ends_at' - a DateTime object with the time the event ends
#### edit_event
  * Purpose: To give the current information about an event and let a user edit it. (see signup and login for user input examples)
    * If the edit is submitted and all goes well redirect to "show_calendar" with params[:cal_id] set. 
    * Otherwise redirect to "edit_event" with params[:notice] set to the string "An error has occurred." And do not change the event. 
    * If an invitee username is invalid (nonexistent, already invited, or the current user), change the event and invite the valid users and redirect to "show_calendar" but in addition to setting params[:cal_id] also set params[:notice] to the string "The following invited usernames are invalid/duplicates and invites were not sent:" followed by the invalid usernames (with a space between each one) 
    * if you are not the owner of the event redirect to edit_event with the params[:notice] "You can not edit this event, contact owner: " followed by the owner of the event's name. 
  * Input:
    * params[:event_id] - An identifier of the event
    * params[:cal_id] - An identifier of the calendar to which the event belongs
    * After the form is submitted:

    * @eventName - Name of the event
    * @eventId - Identifier of the event
    * @eventStarts - DateTime with start of event
    * @eventEnds - DateTime with end of event

    * @invitees - Array of hashes of the current people who have accepted invites (this is only set if you are the event owner) 
      * 'name' - Invitee's name

#### create_calendar
  * Purpose: Allows user to create a calendar, info sent when request.post? is true
    * If creation occurs properly redirect to "show_calendar" with params[:cal_id] set.

  * Input: 
    * params[:cal_id] - An identifier of the calendar
  * Output: None

#### create_event 
  * Purpose: To create an event
    * If the form is submitted and all goes well redirect to "show_calendar" with params[:cal_id] set. 
    * Otherwise redirect to "create_event" with params[:notice] set to the string "An error has occurred." And do not create the event. 
    * If an invitee username is invalid (nonexistent, already invited, or the current user), change the event and invite the valid users and redirect to "show_calendar" but in addition to setting params[:cal_id] also set params[:notice] to the string "The following invited usernames are invalid/duplicates and invites were not sent:" followed by the invalid usernames (with a space between each one)

### before_filter methods
These are in place to ensure you can't access the information of another user, we have already designated which methods these filters apply to you just need to fill them in in application_controller.rb

#### invite_id_matches_user
  * Purpose : Make sure the invite is the current users
     * If it is return true
     * If it doesn't redirect to "show_invites" set params[:notice] to "You can not access that invite." and return false.
  * Input
     * params[:invite_id] - Identifier of the invite
  * Output: None

#### cal_id_matches_user
  * Purpose : Make sure the calendar is the current users
     * If it is return true
     * If it doesn't redirect to "show_calendars" set params[:notice] to "You can not access that item." and return false.
  * Input
     * params[:cal_id] - Identifier of the calendar
  * Output: None

### Testing 
You can test out any ruby code by going into "bearplanner/" folder, and typing "rails console".  This will provide you with an interactive Rails shell, where you can run any ActiveRecord queries using the tables and models you have defined.  Additionally, if you want to directly call any methods you have defined in ~/hw4/bearplanner/app/controllers/bear_planner_controller.rb, you must first type the line: "include Helpers".

### More Background?
Check out https://sites.google.com/a/cs.berkeley.edu/cs186-sp10/assignments/hw4-rails and scroll down to "Background on Ruby on Rails to learn more if you are still confused, or check out the links in our resources. 
 #### Heroku
 The following commands may be useful
   % heroku logs
 Shows the recent logs of your app on heoku
   % heroku console 
 Runs the interactive rails console (i.e. 'rails console' locally) on your heroku app. 
 If you notice any difference between your app locally and on heroku notify the staff immediately. 

##What to turn in

  *hw3.tar - A .tar file of your bearplanner/ directory
  *website.txt - A text file containing ONLY your heroku website url. DO NOT make changes to the website on heroku after the submission deadline, if we notice you have done so we reserve the right to give you a 0 on the assignment. 
  *MY.PARTNERS - Lists the other person you work with, this should be autogenerated when you run the submit command. 

`cd` into your solution's directory and run the `submit hw3` command.  It will automatically collect the relevant files. You don't need to submit any other files, and, if you do, they will be ignored.
